# Hugo Nx Demo

Uses the hugo-installer package to setup the binary

This example uses the Relearn Hugo theme, but we want to use Docsy instead

## Setup

```bash
npm ci
```

## Serve Hugo Docs

```bash
npx nx serve docs
```

## Serve Angular Dashboard that consumes Docs

```bash
npx nx serve dashboard
```
